The annotation storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class is used to specify whether a StorageClass should be the default for a Kubernetes cluster. Here are the options for this annotation:

1. "true"
When set to "true", this StorageClass is designated as the default StorageClass for the cluster.
If a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is created without specifying a StorageClass, Kubernetes will automatically use the default StorageClass.
Only one StorageClass in the cluster should be marked as the default. If multiple classes are marked as default, Kubernetes will select one, but this can lead to unpredictable behavior.
2. "false"
When set to "false", this StorageClass is not the default.
PVCs must explicitly reference this StorageClass to use it.
3. Omitting the Annotation
If the storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class annotation is omitted, the StorageClass is treated as not the default (false behavior).
This is equivalent to setting the annotation to "false".
Example Usage Scenarios -check the yaml files in the folder
"true": You have a general-purpose storage class, such as one backed by a cloud provider's standard disk offering, that you want to be used by default for most applications.
"false": You have a specialized storage class, such as one optimized for high IOPS or low latency, that should only be used by specific applications that explicitly request it.
Omitted: You have multiple StorageClass resources, and you only want to explicitly define the default one. Other classes without this annotation will not be chosen unless specified.
